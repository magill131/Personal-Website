    <h3>All About Me</h3>
    <p id="description">I live in Nashville but grew up in Atlanta. I was a cross country coach for 10 years and still run very often myself. Aside from running, I enjoy movies, music, video games, sports, and having a good time with friends. I also enjoy playing golf on weekends. My favorite sports teams are Atlanta Falcons, Ole Miss, Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Hawks, Nashville Preds, and Bayern Munich soccer. My favorite movies are Princess Bride, Tombstone, and Big Lebowski. My favorite band is Linkin Park. Lastly, I hope to begin a career in software engineering and coding.</p>
